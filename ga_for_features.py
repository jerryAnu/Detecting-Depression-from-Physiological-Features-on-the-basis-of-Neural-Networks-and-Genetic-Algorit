Define a neural network 

Here we build a neural network with one hidden layer.
    input layer: 85 neurons, representing the physiological features of observers
    hidden layer: 60 neurons, using Sigmoid as activation function
    output layer: 4 neurons, representing various levels of depression

The network will be trained with Adam as an optimiser, 
that will hold the current state and will update the parameters
based on the computed gradients.

Its performance will be evaluated using cross-entropy.
